# SPADE (It is easy to train!!)

`I made the codes to aim at synthesizing face images`

## Installation

* PyTorch
* Python
* tqdm
* pillow
* matplotlib
* numpy

## Configuration

* 1 gpu (GeForce RTX 3080 ti)
* batch size is 1

## Dataset

* Image : [CelebAMask-HQ](https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ)
* Segmentation map : [Merging masks and colorizing them](https://github.com/ji-in/CelebAMask-HQ_to_colorImage)

Something to keep in mind : It requires only `png` image. [convert jpg image to png image](https://github.com/ji-in/SPADE-torch-simple/blob/main/convert_jpg_to_png.py)

## Training

```python
python main.py
```
